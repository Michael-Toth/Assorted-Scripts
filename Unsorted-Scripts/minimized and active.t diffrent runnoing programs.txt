    {
    SetTitleMatchMode,2
    DetectHiddenWindows, Off
    IfWinActive, %TheWindowTitle%
    {
    WinMinimize, %TheWindowTitle%
    }
    Else
    {
    IfWinExist, %TheWindowTitle%
    {
    WinGet, winid, ID, %TheWindowTitle%
    DllCall("SwitchToThisWindow", "UInt", winid, "UInt", 1)
    }
    }
    Return
    }

Now that you have the function, you can start using it to create your own hotkeys for specific applications with a line similar to this one, which would assign Alt+X to toggle Firefox between being minimized and active.

    !x::ToggleWinMinimize("Mozilla Firefox")
